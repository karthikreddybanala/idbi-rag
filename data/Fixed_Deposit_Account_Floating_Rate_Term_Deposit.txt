IDBI Bank Floating Rate Term Deposit (FRTD)

Overview:
The Floating Rate Term Deposit (FRTD) is a special type of fixed deposit where the interest rate is not fixed for the entire tenure but moves in line with a benchmark reference rate. This allows investors to benefit from changing market interest rates without closing or rebooking their deposits. The reference rate is linked to the Bank’s Treasury Bill (T-Bill) rates auctioned fortnightly by the RBI and reset annually.

Advantages:
- **Quarterly Interest Payment:** Interest is payable quarterly on the last day of each quarter.
- **Interest Reset:** Every 3 months — on April 1, July 1, October 1, and January 1 each year.
- **Liquidity:** Loan or overdraft facility up to 90% of deposit amount, at 2% p.a. above deposit rate (with up to 1% reduction as per bank policy).
- **Nomination Facility:** Available free of charge.
- **Minor Accounts:** Can be opened jointly with guardian only; minors cannot open independently.
- **Auto-Renewal:** Available for deposits with tenure above 1 year, renewed automatically at prevailing FRTD rates.
- **Tax Deduction:** TDS applicable as per Income Tax guidelines.
- **Premature Withdrawal:**  
  - Minimum lock-in period: 1 year (no withdrawal allowed before 1 year).  
  - After 1 year, applicable rate = average benchmark rate of preceding quarter + mark-up of relevant tenor.
- **Interest Calculation:** As per bank’s existing term deposit guidelines.
- **Senior Citizen Benefit:** Additional 0.50% (50 basis points) over applicable FRTD rate.
